## What Are Real Estate-Backed Business Loans?

A **real estate-backed business loan** uses your commercial property as collateral to fund business operations, growth, or acquisitions—without refinancing your existing mortgage.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Collateral:** Your property (building, land, etc.)
- **Purpose:** Business use (equipment, inventory, acquisition, expansion, etc.)
- **Structure:** Second lien (behind your existing mortgage)
- **Amount:** Typically $200K - $5M
- **Term:** 1-5 years (shorter than mortgages)
- **Rate:** 8-12% (between mortgages and unsecured business loans)

**What makes it different:**

| Feature | Real Estate-Backed | Property Refinance | SBA Loan | Unsecured Business Loan |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|----------|------------------------|
| **Existing mortgage** | Keep it | Replace it | Keep it | Keep it |
| **Speed** | 30-45 days | 90-120 days | 90-120 days | 1-7 days |
| **Rate** | 8-12% | 6-9% | 8-11% | 15-30% |
| **Term** | 1-5 years | 15-30 years | 10-25 years | 6-18 months |
| **Property at risk** | Yes (2nd lien) | Yes (1st lien) | Maybe | No |

## How Real Estate-Backed Business Loans Work

### Step 1: You Own Property with Equity

**Example:**
- Property worth: $2,000,000
- Existing mortgage: $1,000,000
- **Equity:** $1,000,000

You have $1M in equity, but it's doing nothing. It's just sitting there, not working for your business.

### Step 2: You Need Business Capital

**Examples:**
- $500K for equipment
- $300K for inventory
- $800K to buy a competitor
- $400K to open a second location

Traditional options:
- ❌ **Refinance:** Replace your $1M mortgage at 4.5% with $1.5M at 6.5% (lose good rate, 120 days)
- ❌ **SBA loan:** 120-day process, tons of paperwork, maybe approved
- ❌ **Unsecured loan:** 20% interest, 12-month term, stressful payments

### Step 3: Real Estate-Backed Loan Structure

**BuildUp (or similar lender) offers:**
- **Loan amount:** $500K
- **Collateral:** Second lien on your property
- **Rate:** 10%
- **Term:** 3 years
- **Monthly payment:** $16,133

**What happens:**
1. You keep your existing $1M mortgage at 4.5%
2. We place a second lien on the property for $500K
3. If you default, we have claim on the property (after the first lien holder)
4. You get $500K wired to your account in 30-45 days

**Total debt on property:**
- First lien: $1M (your bank)
- Second lien: $500K (us)
- **Total:** $1.5M (75% LTV—still conservative)

## When Real Estate-Backed Business Loans Make Sense

### ✅ **Perfect Fit Scenarios**

**1. You Have a Good Existing Mortgage Rate**

If your current mortgage is at 4-5%, refinancing to get cash means losing that rate and paying 6-7% on the entire balance.

**Math:**
- Current: $1M at 4.5% = $5,067/month
- Refinance to $1.5M at 6.5% = $9,487/month
- **New cost:** +$4,420/month

**Alternative:**
- Keep $1M at 4.5% = $5,067/month
- Add $500K at 10% (BuildUp) = $16,133/month
- **Total:** $21,200/month

Wait—that's MORE expensive monthly!

**But:**
- You keep your 4.5% rate forever (worth ~$200K over life of loan)
- You can pay off the 10% loan in 1-2 years (no prepayment penalty)
- After payoff, you're back to $5,067/month

**Net savings over 5 years:** ~$180K

---

**2. Speed Matters**

**Scenario:** You have an opportunity to buy a competitor for $800K. The seller wants to close in 45 days.

**Options:**
- SBA loan: 90-120 days → Deal dies
- Bank loan: 60-90 days → Deal dies
- Real estate-backed: 30-45 days → **Deal closes**

Sometimes the right capital at the right time is worth a higher rate.

---

**3. Traditional Lenders Won't Approve You**

**Common reasons:**
- Revenue is lumpy (seasonal, project-based)
- You have existing debt
- Business is <2 years old
- Industry is "risky" (construction, restaurants, etc.)

**Real estate-backed advantage:**
- Approval is based on property equity, not perfect cash flow
- As long as you can service the debt + have collateral, you're likely approved

---

**4. You Want Flexibility**

**Scenario:** You need working capital for 12-18 months while you ramp up a new product line.

**Traditional loan:**
- 3-year term minimum
- Fixed payment schedule
- Prepayment penalties

**Real estate-backed:**
- Negotiate interest-only period (first 6-12 months)
- Pay off early when product line cash flows
- Flexible structure

---

### ⚠️ **Maybe a Fit (Depends)**

**1. Your Business Is Breakeven or Slightly Losing Money**

If your business can't service the debt with current cash flow, adding debt is risky.

**Ask yourself:**
- Will this capital generate enough revenue to cover the payment?
- Is there a turnaround plan?
- What happens if revenue doesn't improve?

**Sometimes:** The capital fixes the problem (you need equipment to fulfill orders).  
**Sometimes:** It makes the problem worse (you're using debt to cover ongoing losses).

Be honest.

---

**2. Property Value Might Fluctuate**

If you're in a volatile real estate market (e.g., speculative area, declining industry hub), a drop in property value could affect your ability to refinance later.

**Mitigation:**
- Don't over-leverage (stay <60% LTV)
- Have a clear exit strategy (how will you pay off the loan?)

---

### ❌ **Not a Fit**

**1. You Don't Own Property**

Obvious, but worth saying: This structure requires property collateral. No property = no loan.

**Alternative:** Unsecured business loan, revenue-based financing, or equity investment.

---

**2. You Want the Absolute Lowest Rate**

If rate is your only concern and you have 4 months to wait, refinance your property. It'll be cheaper (6-9% vs 8-12%).

**Trade-off:** You lose speed, flexibility, and your existing mortgage rate.

---

**3. Your Business Is Failing**

If your business is losing money consistently and this capital won't fix it, don't do it.

Adding debt to a failing business just accelerates the failure—and now your property is at risk.

**Better option:** Sell the business, pivot, or shut down before you lose the property.

## Real Estate-Backed vs. Other Options

### vs. Property Refinance

**When refinancing is better:**
- You have a bad existing rate (>7%)
- You want maximum leverage (>70% LTV)
- You have 4+ months to wait
- You're fine replacing your mortgage

**When real estate-backed is better:**
- You have a good existing rate (<6%)
- You need money in 30-45 days
- You only need part of your equity
- You plan to pay off in 1-3 years

---

### vs. SBA Loan

**When SBA is better:**
- You have perfect credit and financials
- You want the lowest rate (8-11%)
- You have 4+ months to wait
- You want a long term (10-25 years)

**When real estate-backed is better:**
- Your credit/financials are good but not perfect
- You need speed (30-45 days)
- You want simplicity (less paperwork than SBA)

---

### vs. Unsecured Business Loan

**When unsecured is better:**
- You need money in 1-7 days (emergency)
- You don't want to risk your property
- Amount is small (<$100K)

**When real estate-backed is better:**
- You need >$200K
- You want a lower rate (8-12% vs 15-30%)
- You want a longer term (1-5 years vs 6-18 months)

### The Underwriting Model

Lenders evaluate **6 factors:**

**1. Property Equity (30% weight)**
- More equity = more cushion = less risk

**2. Loan-to-Value (25% weight)**
- Total debt (existing + new) shouldn't exceed 70% of property value
- Example: $2M property, $1M existing loan, $400K new loan = 70% LTV ✅

**3. Debt Service Coverage (20% weight)**
- Net income must be 1.25x+ the new debt service
- Example: $20K/month payment, need $25K+/month net income

**4. Use of Funds (15% weight)**
- Growth uses (equipment, inventory, acquisition) = ✅
- Survival uses (cover payroll, pay existing debt) = ⚠️

**5. Business Quality (5% weight)**
- Industry, revenue, profitability, trajectory

**6. Borrower Quality (5% weight)**
- Background, credit, experience, reputation

<a name="common-mistakes"></a>
## Common Mistakes (And How to Avoid Them)

### Mistake #1: Borrowing Too Much

**Problem:** "I have $1M equity, I'll borrow $800K!"

**Why it's a problem:**
- High LTV = risky for lender = higher rate or rejection
- Less cushion if property value drops
- Harder to refinance later

**Better approach:** Borrow what you need, not what you can get. Stay <60% LTV.

---

### Mistake #2: Using Capital for Non-Productive Purposes

**Problem:** "I'll use the $500K to cover payroll for 6 months while revenue improves."

**Why it's a problem:**
- If revenue doesn't improve, you've burned $500K and still have a $16K/month payment
- Property is now at risk
- You haven't solved the root problem

**Better approach:** Only borrow for uses that generate revenue or reduce costs (equipment, expansion, efficiency improvements).

---

### Mistake #3: Ignoring the Exit Strategy

**Problem:** "I'll figure out how to pay it off later."

**Why it's a problem:**
- Loans come due
- If you can't refinance or pay off, you risk foreclosure

**Better approach:** Know your exit before you start:
- Pay off with business cash flow over term
- Refinance in year 2-3 (when business has grown)
- Sell property (if planned)
- Business sale/exit event

---

### Mistake #4: Not Shopping Around

**Problem:** Accept the first offer you get.

**Why it's a problem:**
- Rates vary 2-4% between lenders
- Terms differ (prepayment penalties, fees, covenants)
- You might qualify for better

**Better approach:** Get 2-3 quotes, compare total cost (not just rate).
