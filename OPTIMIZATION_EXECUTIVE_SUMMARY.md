## Top 10 Priorities (Start Here)

### 1. Homepage Hero Rewrite
**Current:** "Fast, asset-backed capital when banks can't move."  
**Issue:** Generic, defines against banks, no urgency  
**Fix:** "The deal closes in 14 days. Your bank needs 60. We'll fund it in 7."  
**Impact:** +15-20% engagement

### 2. Multi-Step Qualification Flow
**Current:** Single "Apply" form  
**Fix:** 4-step qualification (90 seconds) → instant yes/no/maybe  
**Why:** Pre-qualifies 80% of leads, reduces wasted time  
**Impact:** +30% application completion rate

### 3. Trust Badge Stack
**Add:**
- Licensed in [X] states
- SSL/Security badges
- Google Reviews widget (4.9/5)
- "Member of [Association]"
**Impact:** +10-15% trust/conversion

### 4. Video Testimonials
**Current:** Text testimonials (good but weak)  
**Fix:** 2-3 short (30-60 sec) video testimonials with real borrowers + properties  
**Impact:** +20-25% trust

### 5. Exit-Intent Capture
**Add:** Popup when user tries to leave  
**Offer:** "Get a free 2-min deal assessment (no credit pull)"  
**Impact:** Capture 15-20% of abandoning visitors

### 6. "Our Story" Section
**Current:** Mission-focused About page  
**Fix:** Add "Why We Built BuildUp" narrative explaining downside-first philosophy  
**Impact:** Humanizes brand, builds connection

### 7. Interactive Calculator
**Add:** "What will my loan cost?" estimator  
**Inputs:** Loan amount, LTV, term  
**Output:** Estimated rate, payment, total cost  
**Impact:** +25% engagement, reduces "sticker shock"

### 8. Abandoned Application Emails
**Current:** No follow-up on incomplete applications  
**Fix:** 3-email sequence (2 hours, 1 day, 3 days after abandonment)  
**Impact:** Recover 20-30% of incomplete applications

### 9. CTA Optimization
**Current:** "Apply Now", "Get Started", "Learn More"  
**Fix:** Make outcome-focused:
- "Get Your Answer in 24 Hours"
- "See If Your Deal Qualifies (2 min, no credit pull)"
- "Talk to a Real Person (Not a Bot)"
**Impact:** +15-20% click-through

### 10. Real-Time Proof
**Add:**
- Activity feed: "Loan approved in Phoenix, AZ ($450K) - 12 min ago"
- Deal counter: "$15.7M funded in 2026 so far"
- Map of funded deals by state
**Impact:** +10% social proof/trust

## Key Gaps Identified

### 1. Branding
- No logo (text-only)
- Generic tagline
- Limited personality/voice distinction
- Missing emotional connection

**Fix:** Develop logo + refresh tagline + add brand story

### 2. Language
- Too generic ("fast approvals" claimed by everyone)
- Missing specificity ("Average 7-day close" vs "fast")
- Weak CTAs
- Limited storytelling

**Fix:** Add specificity, numbers, outcomes to every claim

### 3. Trust Signals
- No team photos/bios
- Limited social proof beyond testimonials
- No real-time proof elements
- Missing third-party validation

**Fix:** Add team section, reviews, activity feed, badges

### 4. User Flow
- No dynamic routing (borrower vs lender)
- Single-step application (high abandonment)
- No abandonment recovery
- Limited internal linking

**Fix:** Multi-step flows, email recovery, guided navigation

### 5. Differentiation
- Doesn't clearly state what makes you different
- "Downside-first" philosophy mentioned but not explained
- Missing "Why BuildUp?" narrative

**Fix:** Lead with philosophy, explain approach, show operator background
