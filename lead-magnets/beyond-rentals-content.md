# Beyond Rentals: 7 Ways to Put Real Estate Equity to Work

**A Practical Guide for Business Owners**

---

## Introduction

You've built your business. You own your building. And now you're sitting on significant equity that's doing... nothing.

Most business owners think they have two options:
1. Refinance the property (expensive, slow, puts existing mortgage at risk)
2. Sell the property (lose the asset, create tax liabilities)

**There's a third option:** Use your property as collateral for growth capital while keeping your existing mortgage intact.

This guide shows you 7 practical ways to deploy real estate equity for business growth—without selling, without refinancing, and without disrupting your current operations.

---

## The Problem with Traditional Options

### Option 1: Refinance Your Property

**Pros:**
- Access to capital
- Lower interest rates (sometimes)

**Cons:**
- Replaces your existing mortgage (lose good terms)
- Lengthy approval process (90-120 days)
- Personal financial exposure
- May trigger due-on-sale clauses
- Expensive closing costs

### Option 2: Sell the Property

**Pros:**
- Maximum liquidity
- One-time event

**Cons:**
- Lose the asset forever
- Capital gains tax (15-20% federal + state)
- Depreciation recapture tax
- No future appreciation
- May need to lease back (new landlord risk)

### Option 3: Traditional Business Loan

**Pros:**
- Don't touch property
- Standard process

**Cons:**
- High interest rates (12-25% for unsecured)
- Revenue-based (not asset-based)
- Short terms (6-18 months typical)
- UCC-1 blanket liens
- Personal guarantees always required

### The Alternative: Real Estate-Backed Business Loans

**Pros:**
- Keep your existing mortgage
- Keep your property
- Lower rates than unsecured debt (8-12%)
- Longer terms (1-5 years)
- Faster funding (30 days)
- Tax-deductible interest

**Cons:**
- Property must have equity
- Lien placed on property
- Not as cheap as refinancing (but much faster)
- Smaller universe of lenders

## 7 Ways to Deploy Real Estate Equity

### 1. Equipment Purchase

**Use Case:** Manufacturing, construction, medical practices, logistics

**Why It Works:**
- Equipment often pays for itself (ROI-positive)
- Traditional equipment leasing is expensive (15-25% effective rate)
- SBA loans take 90-120 days
- Real estate backing = lower rate + faster funding

**Example:**
- Manufacturing company needs $500K for CNC machine
- Building worth $2M, existing mortgage $800K
- Equity available: $1.2M
- BuildUp loan: $500K at 10%, 3-year term
- Monthly payment: $16,133
- New equipment increases capacity 40% → $80K/month additional revenue
- ROI: 5x monthly payment

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Equipment has clear ROI
- Current revenue supports debt service
- Waiting 90 days costs more than higher rate

---

### 2. Inventory Financing

**Use Case:** Retailers, distributors, seasonal businesses

**Why It Works:**
- Inventory turns into cash (30-90 days)
- Purchase orders in hand (low risk)
- Traditional inventory lines require perfect credit
- Real estate backing = approved on asset, not cash flow

**Example:**
- Distributor gets $1M purchase order
- Needs $600K to buy inventory
- Building worth $1.5M, mortgage $400K
- BuildUp loan: $600K at 11%, 1-year term
- Gross margin on PO: 35% = $350K profit
- Loan cost: ~$66K interest = net profit $284K
- ROI: 47% return on equity deployed

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Purchase orders in hand
- Proven customer relationships
- Inventory turns in <90 days

---

### 3. Business Acquisition

**Use Case:** Buying competitor, supplier, or complementary business

**Why It Works:**
- SBA loans require 10-20% down + take 90-120 days
- Sellers want fast close
- Real estate backing = speed advantage

**Example:**
- Opportunity to buy competitor for $800K
- Seller wants close in 45 days
- Building worth $2.5M, mortgage $1M
- BuildUp loan: $800K at 10%, 5-year term
- Acquired business does $200K EBITDA
- Debt service: $17K/month ($204K/year)
- Cash flow positive from day 1

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Acquisition is accretive (profitable immediately)
- Synergies are clear
- Seller won't wait for SBA process

---

### 4. Expansion Capital

**Use Case:** New location, additional capacity, product line launch

**Why It Works:**
- Expansion = growth (not survival)
- Banks want 2+ years of profitable expansion history (chicken/egg)
- Real estate backing = funds growth before proving it works

**Example:**
- HVAC company opening 2nd location
- Needs $400K for trucks, tools, initial payroll
- Building worth $1.8M, mortgage $900K
- BuildUp loan: $400K at 9.5%, 3-year term
- New location revenue: $120K/month
- Debt service: $12,787/month
- Breakeven: 30 days
- After ramp: $50K+/month net income

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Expansion has clear revenue model
- Core business is profitable
- Speed to market matters

---

### 5. Debt Consolidation

**Use Case:** Multiple credit cards, MCAs, short-term debt

**Why It Works:**
- Credit cards = 18-28% interest
- Merchant cash advances = 30-80% APR (effective)
- Real estate-backed = 8-12% fixed
- Save thousands monthly in interest

**Example:**
- Business has:
  - $150K credit card debt (22% avg)
  - $200K MCA (45% effective APR)
  - $100K equipment lease (18%)
- Total monthly debt service: $28K
- Building worth $1.2M, mortgage $400K
- BuildUp loan: $450K at 10%, 3-year term
- New monthly payment: $14,500
- **Savings: $13,500/month = $162K/year**

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Current debt is expensive (15%+ rates)
- Business is profitable but over-leveraged
- Want to fix rate + extend term

---

### 6. Working Capital / Cash Flow Buffer

**Use Case:** Seasonal businesses, contract-based, lumpy revenue

**Why It Works:**
- Revenue-based lenders charge 20-40% effective
- Lines of credit require perfect financials
- Real estate backing = approved on asset, terms on business

**Example:**
- Landscaping company (seasonal revenue)
- Needs $300K to cover payroll Jan-Apr
- Building worth $1M, mortgage $300K
- BuildUp loan: $300K at 11%, 2-year term
- Interest-only option during off-season: $2,750/month
- Season revenue (May-Oct): $1.2M gross
- Debt service during season: $15,621/month
- Buffer eliminates credit card float

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Business is seasonal/cyclical
- Annual profit covers debt service easily
- Need smooth cash flow vs. emergency borrowing

---

### 7. Tenant Improvement / Build-Out

**Use Case:** Retail, restaurant, medical office, manufacturing

**Why It Works:**
- Landlord TI allowances are rarely enough
- Traditional build-out loans require perfect credit
- Improvements increase business value + property value

**Example:**
- Dental practice wants to add 4 operatories
- TI cost: $250K
- Building worth $1.5M, mortgage $600K
- BuildUp loan: $250K at 9%, 3-year term
- New operatories = 2 additional providers
- Additional revenue: $60K/month
- Debt service: $7,977/month
- Net gain: $52K/month

**When It Makes Sense:**
- TI increases revenue capacity
- ROI is clear
- Own the building (benefit from property value increase)

---

## When Does This Make Sense?

### ✅ Good Fit If:

- You own commercial real estate with equity (30%+ equity-to-value)
- Operating business is profitable (or acquisition target is)
- Need $200K-$5M
- Want to keep existing mortgage
- Speed matters (30-45 days vs 90-120)
- Use is growth-oriented (equipment, inventory, acquisition, expansion)

### ⚠️ Maybe a Fit If:

- Property has <30% equity (might still work, case-by-case)
- Business is breakeven (but growing)
- Need is working capital (depends on use + repayment ability)

### ❌ Not a Fit If:

- No real estate owned
- Property value <$500K
- Business is losing money consistently
- Use is to cover ongoing losses (survival debt)
- Existing senior liens exceed 70% LTV

## Tax Considerations

**Consult your CPA, but generally:**

### Interest Deductibility
- Business loan interest is tax-deductible (unlike personal mortgage interest in many cases)
- Reduces effective cost by your marginal tax rate
- Example: 10% loan, 25% tax bracket = 7.5% effective cost

### Depreciation
- Equipment purchased can be depreciated (Section 179, bonus depreciation)
- May offset interest expense
- Can create tax loss in year 1 (good thing)

### Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
- Generally not an issue for business loans (consult CPA)

### Property Taxes
- Lien doesn't change property tax assessment
- TI improvements may increase assessed value (varies by state)

---

## Risk Considerations

### What Could Go Wrong?

**Scenario 1: Business Revenue Declines**
- You have debt service obligations
- Property is at risk if you can't pay
- Mitigation: Only borrow if current cash flow supports debt service + buffer

**Scenario 2: Property Value Drops**
- Less relevant (loan is based on current value)
- Only matters if you wanted to refinance later
- Mitigation: Don't over-leverage (stay <60% LTV)

**Scenario 3: Use of Funds Doesn't Work Out**
- Equipment doesn't perform
- Acquisition doesn't integrate
- Expansion location fails
- Mitigation: Underwrite conservatively, have Plan B

**Scenario 4: Interest Rates Rise**
- Fixed-rate loan = protected
- Variable-rate loan = could increase
- Mitigation: Choose fixed if you want certainty

### How We Mitigate Risk

1. **Conservative LTV (60% max):** Substantial equity cushion
2. **DSCR Requirements (1.25+ min):** Current cash flow must support debt service + 25% buffer
3. **First Lien Position (when possible):** Priority claim on property
4. **Use of Funds Review:** Only fund growth, not survival
5. **Skin in the Game:** Borrower equity contribution for acquisitions

## FAQs

**Q: Will this affect my existing mortgage?**  
A: No. We take a second lien position. Your existing mortgage stays exactly as-is. (Exception: Some mortgages have clauses prohibiting additional liens—check yours.)

**Q: What if I don't own the property personally, my LLC does?**  
A: That's fine. We lend to entities. The entity guarantees the loan, and principals may need to personally guarantee as well.

**Q: Can I pay off the loan early?**  
A: Yes. Prepayment terms vary by deal. Some have no penalty, some have declining penalties. We'll discuss during term sheet phase.

**Q: What if my business is new (< 2 years)?**  
A: Harder, but possible if:  
  - Property equity is strong (40%+)  
  - You have industry experience  
  - Use of funds is low-risk (e.g., inventory with PO in hand)

**Q: Do you lend in all 50 states?**  
A: Most states, yes. Some have restrictions on lending structures. We'll confirm during initial call.

**Q: What if I'm in the middle of refinancing my property?**  
A: Let's talk. Refinancing + a business loan might make sense simultaneously, or waiting might be better. Depends on the numbers.

**Q: Is there a minimum/maximum loan size?**  
A: Minimum: $200K (below that, costs don't make sense)  
Maximum: $5M (above that, we may syndicate or refer to larger lenders)

**Q: How much does this cost (fees)?**  
A: Origination: 2-4 points (based on size + complexity)  
Appraisal: $500-1,500 (you pay directly to appraiser)  
Legal: Varies (we have standard docs, minimal unless complex deal)

**Q: What's your approval rate?**  
A: ~30%. We say no a lot. Why? Because we only want to fund deals that work for you AND us. A loan that fails helps no one.

## About BuildUp Capital

We started BuildUp because traditional lending doesn't work for growth-stage businesses.

Banks want 2+ years of perfect history before funding growth. That's backwards.

Private lenders charge 20-40% rates. That's predatory.

Real estate is the ultimate collateral—stable, liquid, appraised. Why not use it to fuel business growth?

**Our Philosophy:**
1. **Downside First:** We underwrite conservatively. If the deal barely works in our model, we say no.
2. **Alignment:** We only make money if you succeed. Your business growing is good for everyone.
3. **Transparency:** No hidden fees, no bait-and-switch, no games. What we say is what you get.
4. **Speed:** We know time = money. 30-45 days, not 90-120.
