## Why Private Credit Wins for Income Seekers

### 1. Predictable Monthly Cash Flow
Unlike STRs (seasonal) or stocks (dividends tiny), private credit delivers **fixed monthly payments**. You know exactly what you'll earn.

### 2. No Operational Burden
- ✅ No tenants
- ✅ No toilets
- ✅ No turnover
- ✅ No cleaning
- ✅ No guest complaints
- ✅ No platform algorithm changes

### 3. Asset-Backed Protection
Every loan is secured by real estate worth **1.5-2x the loan amount**. If borrower defaults, you're protected by the collateral.

### 4. Less Volatility Than Stocks
While stocks can drop 30-40% in a year, private credit delivers steady returns regardless of market conditions.

### 5. Diversification Beyond Properties
If you already own rental properties, private credit diversifies your real estate exposure without adding operational complexity.

## Who Is Private Credit Best For?

✅ **You're a great fit if:**
- You want passive income without active management
- You're tired of tenant/guest headaches
- You have capital but limited time
- You want downside protection via collateral
- You're seeking 10-14% annual returns
- You're comfortable with 12-36 month lock-up periods

❌ **Not ideal if:**
- You need instant liquidity (stick to stocks)
- You want equity upside (stick to property ownership)
- You're seeking 20%+ returns (higher risk ventures)
- You have <$50k to invest (minimum thresholds apply)

## Common Questions

### "What if the borrower doesn't pay?"
The loan is secured by real estate collateral worth 1.5-2x the loan amount. If the borrower defaults, we foreclose and sell the property to recover principal + interest.

### "How is this different from REITs?"
REITs own properties and distribute rental income. Private credit lends to property owners and earns interest. REITs are liquid but volatile; private credit is illiquid but stable.

### "What returns can I expect?"
Typical returns: 10-14% annually, paid monthly. Higher than rental income (5-8% net), lower than risky ventures (15-25%).

### "How liquid is my investment?"
Loans have 12-36 month terms. You receive monthly payments but cannot withdraw principal until maturity. Plan for illiquidity.

### "What are the tax implications?"
Interest income is taxed as ordinary income. Consult your CPA, but many investors offset with real estate losses or depreciation from other properties.
