## Common Mistakes That Delay Approval

❌ **Incomplete financials** → Missing bank statements, tax returns
- **Fix:** Gather all docs upfront (Day 1)

❌ **Unclear exit strategy** → "I'll figure it out later"
- **Fix:** Have concrete refinance or sale plan before applying

❌ **Low collateral value** → Property worth less than expected
- **Fix:** Get pre-appraisal or BPO (Broker Price Opinion) first

❌ **Credit issues** → Unpaid collections, recent bankruptcy
- **Fix:** Be upfront about credit history (we work with 620+ scores)

❌ **No contractor lined up** → Delays renovation start
- **Fix:** Have licensed contractor ready with scope & budget

❌ **Weak proof of funds** → Can't show down payment source
- **Fix:** Seasoned funds (in account 60+ days) or gift letter
