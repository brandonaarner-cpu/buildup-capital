## Email 2: Day 2 (Case Study)

**Subject:** Real Example: $750K Equipment Purchase (How It Worked)

**Preview Text:** Metal fabricator used property equity instead of refinancing

**Body:**

[First Name],

Yesterday I sent you the "Beyond Rentals" guide. Today, I want to share a real example (details changed for privacy).

**The Situation:**
- Metal fabrication company
- Owned their $2.2M building (existing $900K mortgage)
- Needed $750K for a CNC machine + robotic welder
- Traditional options:
  - Refinance building: 90-120 days, lose great existing rate
  - Equipment lease: 18% effective rate, 5-year term
  - SBA loan: 4-month process, tons of paperwork

**What They Did:**
- BuildUp loan: $750K at 9.5%, 4-year term
- Second lien on building (kept existing mortgage)
- Funded in 32 days

**The Results:**
- Equipment increased capacity 45%
- Added $180K/month in new revenue
- Debt service: $19K/month
- **Equipment paid for itself in 18 months**
- Company hired 6 more people

**Why It Worked:**
- Speed (customer had orders waiting)
- Rate (cheaper than lease, faster than SBA)
- No disruption to existing financing

**Does this sound familiar?**

## Email 3: Day 4 (Process Transparency)

**Subject:** How Our Underwriting Works (Transparent Process)

**Preview Text:** The 6 factors we evaluate + what disqualifies a deal

**Body:**

[First Name],

Most lenders are a black box. You submit an application, wait weeks, and get a "yes" or "no" with no explanation.

We hate that.

So here's exactly how we evaluate deals:

### The 6-Factor Model

**1. Property Equity (Weight: 30%)**
- Property value vs. existing liens
- We want 30%+ equity minimum
- Sweet spot: 40-60% equity
- Example: $2M property, $1M mortgage = $1M equity = ✅

**2. Loan-to-Value (Weight: 25%)**
- Our loan + existing liens can't exceed 70% of property value
- Example: $2M property, $1M mortgage, $400K our loan = 70% LTV = ✅
- Why 70%? Cushion for value fluctuations + foreclosure costs

**3. Debt Service Coverage (Weight: 20%)**
- Your current net income vs. new debt service
- We want 1.25x DSCR minimum
- Example: $20K/month new payment, need $25K/month net income = ✅
- Why 1.25x? Room for revenue volatility

**4. Use of Funds (Weight: 15%)**
- Growth uses (equipment, inventory, acquisition, expansion) = ✅
- Survival uses (cover payroll, pay existing debt) = ⚠️
- Why? We only fund productive uses

**5. Business Quality (Weight:** 5%)**
- 2+ years operating history preferred
- Profitable (or acquisition target is)
- Industry matters (we know some better than others)

**6. Borrower Quality (Weight: 5%)**
- Background check (criminal, credit)
- Previous business experience
- Industry reputation

---

### What Disqualifies a Deal (We'll Tell You Upfront)

❌ Property value <$500K (economics don't work)  
❌ Less than 20% equity in property  
❌ Business is losing money (with no clear turnaround plan)  
❌ Use of funds is to cover ongoing losses  
❌ Borrower has fraud/embezzlement history  
❌ Property is in foreclosure or has liens we can't resolve

P.S. Next email (Saturday): I'll answer the #1 objection I hear—"Why not just refinance my building?"

---

## Email 4: Day 6 (Objection Handling)

**Subject:** "Why not just refinance my building?"

**Preview Text:** When refinancing makes sense (and when it doesn't)

**Body:**

[First Name],

The #1 question I get: **"Why wouldn't I just refinance my building?"**

Fair question. Let's break it down.

### When Refinancing Makes Sense

✅ You have a terrible existing rate (>7%)  
✅ You're planning to hold the property 10+ years  
✅ You need maximum leverage (>70% LTV)  
✅ You have 90-120 days to wait  
✅ Your business credit is perfect  

**If that's you, refinance. Seriously.** Lower rate + longer term + max dollars = best option.

---

### When Our Structure Makes Sense

✅ You have a GOOD existing mortgage (want to keep it)  
✅ You need money in 30-45 days (not 120)  
✅ You want to avoid disrupting current financing  
✅ You only need part of your equity (not all)  
✅ You might pay it off early (1-3 years)

---

### Real Example: When Refinancing Didn't Make Sense

**Client Situation:**
- Building worth $3M
- Existing mortgage: $1.2M at 4.5% (locked in 2019)
- Needed: $600K for business acquisition
- Timeframe: Close in 45 days or lose deal

**Option 1: Refinance**
- New loan: $1.8M at 6.5%
- Save existing 4.5% rate? Nope, gone.
- Closing costs: $45K
- Timeline: 90-120 days (deal would die)
- New payment: $11,385 (vs. $6,082 before = +$5,303/month)

**Option 2: BuildUp (What They Did)**
- BuildUp loan: $600K at 10%, 3-year term
- Keep existing $1.2M mortgage at 4.5%
- Timeline: 35 days (closed the acquisition)
- New payment: $6,082 (existing) + $19,336 (BuildUp) = $25,418/month

**Wait, that's more expensive!**

Yes, **monthly**. But:
- They kept their 4.5% mortgage (worth ~$40K/year savings over life of loan)
- They closed the acquisition (worth $300K/year EBITDA)
- They can pay off our loan in year 2-3 when acquisition cash flows (no prepayment penalty)

**3-year cost comparison:**
- Refinance: $410K total interest + $45K closing = $455K
- BuildUp: $96K (our interest) + $219K (existing mortgage) = $315K
- **Savings: $140K**

Plus they closed the deal.

---

**The point:** It depends on your situation.

- If you need max dollars + have perfect credit + have 4 months, refinance.
- If you need speed + want to keep existing financing + will pay off in 1-3 years, we might make sense.

Want to run your numbers? Book a call and we'll model both options for you.
