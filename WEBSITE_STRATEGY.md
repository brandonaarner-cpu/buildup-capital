# BuildUp Capital - Website Strategy & Optimization Plan
**Created:** 2026-02-08  
**Goal:** Premium website that attracts HNW capital + qualified borrowers

## Brand Positioning

**Mission:** Empower small businesses through real estate-backed capital that protects downside and builds relationships.
